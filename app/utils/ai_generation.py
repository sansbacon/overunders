- Point spreads typically range from 1-14 points, with most being 3-7 points
- Over/under totals typically range from 38-55 points, with most being 42-48 points
- Consider team strengths: strong teams (Chiefs, Bills, 49ers) vs weaker teams should have larger spreads
- Realistic spread examples: Chiefs -6.5 vs Broncos, Bills -3 vs Dolphins, Cowboys -4.5 vs Giants
- Realistic over/under examples: Chiefs vs Chargers O/U 47.5, Bills vs Patriots O/U 43.5

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use REAL NFL teams and realistic divisional/conference matchups that could occur in Week {week_number}
2. Consider the NFL schedule structure: teams play within their division twice, and against other divisions on rotation
3. Use realistic betting lines based on team strength and typical NFL scoring patterns
4. Point spreads typically range from 1-14 points, with most being 3-7 points
5. Over/under totals typically range from 38-55 points, with most being 42-48 points
6. Consider team strengths: strong teams (Chiefs, Bills, 49ers) vs weaker teams should have larger spreads

REALISTIC TEAM MATCHUPS FOR WEEK {week_number}:
- Use actual NFL teams from these divisions:
  AFC East: Bills, Dolphins, Patriots, Jets
  AFC North: Ravens, Bengals, Browns, Steelers
  AFC South: Titans, Colts, Texans, Jaguars
  AFC West: Chiefs, Chargers, Raiders, Broncos
  NFC East: Cowboys, Eagles, Giants, Commanders
  NFC North: Packers, Lions, Bears, Vikings
  NFC South: Saints, Falcons, Panthers, Buccaneers
  NFC West: 49ers, Seahawks, Cardinals, Rams

- Common Week {week_number} matchup types:
  * Divisional games (teams in same division)
  * Inter-conference games (AFC vs NFC)
  * Conference games (AFC vs AFC, NFC vs NFC)
- Avoid impossible matchups (teams don't play themselves)
- Consider realistic scheduling: strong teams often play each other, divisional rivals meet twice per season

REALISTIC BETTING LINES:
- Spread examples: Chiefs -6.5 vs Broncos, Bills -3 vs Dolphins, Cowboys -4.5 vs Giants
- Over/under examples: Chiefs vs Chargers O/U 47.5, Bills vs Patriots O/U 43.5

Generate exactly {question_count} yes/no questions with the following JSON format:

Requirements:
- Mix of spread and over/under questions (roughly 50/50 split)
